However, the Bulls are very sensitive and kind and they would like to be like that all the time, only that life has taught them not to pay off. This means that Taurus will be kind and kind whenever others allow him to, that is, when they themselves are polite and kind, but he will show the strength of his stubbornness and opposition, if you try to stand in his way.',
